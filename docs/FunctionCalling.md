## Introduction
Function calling in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the ability of these models to execute predefined functions based on the input they receive. This capability enhances the versatility and applicability of LLMs in various domains.

## What is Function Calling?
Function calling allows LLMs to invoke specific functions during their execution. This can be used to perform tasks such as data retrieval, calculations, or any other operation that requires external logic.

## Why Use Function Calling?
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Allows LLMs to perform complex tasks that require external logic.
- **Modularity**: Keeps the model's core logic separate from specific functionalities.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the need for the model to generate complex logic internally.

## How to Implement Function Calling

### Using OpenAI's GPT-3
To implement function calling with OpenAI's GPT-3, you need to define the functions and then use the model to generate the function calls based on the input.

#### Example Setup
```javascript
const { OpenAI } = require('openai');

const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
});

async function callFunction(prompt) {
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
        messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
    });
    const functionCall = completion.choices[0].message.content;
    return eval(functionCall); // Be cautious with eval
}
